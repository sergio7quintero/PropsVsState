Deep Dive on Props vs State with react

Props are used to pass data and functions between parent and child components

This project is a React product filtering table that uses useState to manage search and stock filter states. The app relies on props to pass data between components, ensuring a modular and efficient UI. Users can type in the search bar to filter products or check a box to show only in-stock items, making for an interactive and responsive experience.
