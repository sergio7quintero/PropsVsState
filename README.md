# PropsVsState
Deep Dive on Props vs State with react

How useState is Used
The application utilizes the useState hook in the FilterableProductTable component to manage the following states:
filterText: A string that tracks the search input and filters products accordingly.
inStockOnly: A boolean that determines whether only in-stock products should be displayed.

How Props is Used
Props are used to pass data and functions between parent and child components

FilterableProductTable â†’ SearchBar
Passes down filterText, inStockOnly, and their corresponding setter functions (onFilterTextChange, onInStockOnlyChange).
Enables SearchBar to update the state when the user types or checks the box.

This project is a React product filtering table that uses useState to manage search and stock filter states. The app relies on props to pass data between components, ensuring a modular and efficient UI. Users can type in the search bar to filter products or check a box to show only in-stock items, making for an interactive and responsive experience.
